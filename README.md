# OrigamiSimulator - *Supporting Sequential Steps*

This project is a fork of the original [OrigamiSimulator](https://github.com/amandaghassaei/OrigamiSimulator) by Amanda Ghassaei.  
Our goal is to extend the simulation framework to support **sequential folding steps**, enabling step-by-step origami motion visualization rather than simultaneous crease folding.

> This WebGL app simulates how any origami crease pattern will fold. 
> It may look a little different from what you typically think of as
> "origami" - rather than folding paper in a set of sequential steps,
> this simulation attempts to fold every crease simultaneously.
